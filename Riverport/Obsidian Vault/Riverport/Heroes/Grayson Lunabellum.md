*a.k.a. Fenrir, The Wolf Arcane*

## [[The Monster At Summer Camp]]
Grayson would attend summer camp at [[Lake Origin]]. In a desperate attempt to make friends, he would keep secret anything he thought would give away that he was a Werewolf. It was here, at this camp where he would first meet [[Lucas Kettleburn]] and [[Marion Baker X]], forging lifelong bonds. Grayson, Lucas, and Marion were nigh inseperable, galliantly finding adventure wherever they could.
