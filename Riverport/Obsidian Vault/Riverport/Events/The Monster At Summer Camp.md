In this flashback special, [[Grayson Lunabellum|Fenrir]] recounts when he first met [[Lucas Kettleburn|Artificer]] and [[Marion Baker X|Scarlet X]], at Summer Camp at [[Lake Origin]]. It serves as an origin story for [[Moonlight Investigations]], even if they hadn't become true heroes yet. They thwart [[Sk√∂ll]] attempting to pull off some campfire story, though it would have several ramifications later.
